# Sales Analysis and Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales data from 2009 to 2011. The analysis includes sales trends, market basket analysis using association rules, price elasticity, and geographic sales performance. Forecasting techniques are applied to predict future sales trends.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading**: Import and prepare datasets from 2009-2010 and 2010-2011.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify sales trends, top products, and customer segmentation.
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Use the Apriori algorithm to identify product associations.
- **Price Elasticity**: Analyze how price changes influence sales volumes.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Compare sales performance across different regions.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Implement time series forecasting to predict future sales.

## Key Findings
- **Sales Trends**: Identified peak sales periods and top-performing products.
- **Association Rules**: Discovered frequently bought together products.
- **Price Sensitivity**: Determined products with high price elasticity indicating consumer sensitivity.
- **Regional Performance**: Highlighted countries with significant sales, focusing on top markets.
